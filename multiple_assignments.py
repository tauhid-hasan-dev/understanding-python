# Multiple Assignment = allows us to assign multiple variables at the same line of code.

age = 30
name = 'Tauhid Hasan'
isDeveloper = True

print(age)
print(name)
print(isDeveloper)

# ----> we can write this in one line using multiple assignment technique
id, student, isStudent = 56, "Asik hasan", True

print(id)
print(student)
print(isStudent)

# ----> If the value of multiple variable is same we can write them like this

hasan = 40
mehedi = 40
muaz = 40
mohsin = 40


hasan = mehedi = muaz = mohsin = 40

print(hasan)
print(mehedi)
print(muaz)
